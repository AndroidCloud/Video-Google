 vGoogle : A google approach to content based video retrieval

 The aim of this project is to develop a content based video search system for news videos. Our method is based on work by Prof Andrew Zisserman et. al. Major contributions are in devloping methods/code for indexing and retrieval of visual words. A text retrieval like (inverted file systems and document rankings using tf-idf) approach is used for retriveing and ranking of results. Our system is efficient and quick (query time is less than few seconds for hours of news data).
